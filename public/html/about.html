  <h1>About the "Extraterrestrial Communication Training"</h1>
<br>
  <p>The language game you have just played is not unlike the game of Chinese Whispers or Telephone we play as children, passing messages along and seeing how they change. While you were told that you were learning an alien language, you were in fact receiving the responses from a previous player, and your responses will be used as the "alien language" for the next. Some cognitive scientists and linguists think that this kind of itterated learning might play a great role in how languages change over time, and your participation has helped us at LEAP test some of these hypotheses. For more detailed information, please see <a href="../reference/PNAS_2008_Kirby_withSI.pdf"> a current research paper on the topic</a>.<p>

<br>

  <h4>PLEASE: Do not share this information with other people who might be taking the experiment, as it may bias their results</h4>
