  <h1>Extraterrestrial Communication Training</h1>

  <p> The following langauge game has been designed by a team of exo-linguists as part of a program to prepare astronauts for extraterrestrial encounters. By taking part in the game, you should gain a cognitive advantage for quickly learning exotic language systems, in particular ones we think alien species might use.</p>

  <p> The language training consists of 3 rounds, each round having
  two phases: a learning phase and a production phase </p>

  <p> During the
  learning phase, you will be shown a series of images with text below in an alien type language used to describe the scene. It is your job to compare these and try to learn as much of the alien language as
  possible. Each learning phase is three minutes, and as there is no pause, please pay close attention while the images are playing. There is a break after each round, so please rest then if you need to.</p>

  <p> In the second phase, production, you will see another set of images. There will be a text box for you to enter how you think an alien using this language would describe each image. If you are not sure, just use your intuition to create a response that feels most likely based on what you saw.</P>

  <p> While humans intuitively understand speech in words, spoken language has no clear pauses
  between them; 'Let's go get some lunch!' when recorded appears like
  'letsgogetsomelunch' acoustically. Other
  communication systems should be similar, and so the alien
  speech has no marking of structure either.

  <p> You will have up to 45
  minutes to complete the task - in our lab typical completions times range
  from 20-25 minutes, so there is no need to rush, but please do complete the three rounds in one sitting. PLEASE complete the game in a quiet environment, without other web pages or distractions such as cell phones and people present.<p>

  <p>Please press the button below when ready. </p>
